    5.  Seprators:- () Parentheses
                    [] Brakets
                    {} Braces
                     ; Semicolon
                     : Colon
                     , Comma
                     . Period
                    :: Colons

    6.  Operators:- + - * / % (Arithmatic Operators)
                    += -= *= /= %= (Arithmatic Compund Operators)
                    < > <= >= == != (Relational Operators)
                    || && ! (Logical Operators)

                    ?: (Short Hand if...else) (Ternary Operator)

                    Bitwise Operators:-
                                ~ (Bitwise Unary NOT)
                                & (Bitwise AND)
                                | (Bitwise OR)
                                ^ (Bitwise EXCULSIVE OR)

                              | A | B | A&B | A|B | A^B | ~A |
                              | 0 | 0 |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1 |
                              | 0 | 1 |  0  |  1  |  1  |  1 |
                              | 1 | 0 |  0  |  1  |  1  |  0 |
                              | 1 | 1 |  1  |  1  |  0  |  0 |

                    >>  (Shift Right)
                    >>> (Shift Right Zero Fill)
                    <<  (Shift Left)
